# App Title
HuKi - Hungarian Hiking App

# Short Description
HuKi is a hiking app which helps you explore the hiking trails of Hungary.

# Long Description
Hungarian hiking map for hikers and nature explorers.

HuKi is based on OpenStreetMap and it integrates with the Hungarian hiking layer and the official hiking trails.

It does not include hike collections, but it has a hike recommendation function which navigates to the popular hike collection platforms and any GPX track can be imported and shown.

HuKi is my hobby project, I develop it in my free time and I'm happy to receive any feedback to make it more useful :)
