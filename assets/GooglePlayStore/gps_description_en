# Short Description
HuKi is a hiking app which helps you explore the hiking trails of Hungary.

# Long Description
HuKi is an OpenStreetMap based hiking map for hikers and nature lovers, which uses the Hungarian hiking layer.

HuKi can be useful if you want to see the hiking trails nearby, you are planning a hike or want to do a hike based on a GPX track.

HuKi is my hobby project, I develop it in my free time and I'm happy to receive any feedback to make it more useful :)

- OKT - National Blue Trail
HuKi can show the OKT - National Blue Trails for blue trail hikers. The imported OKT GPX can show the stamp locations as well.

- Hiking routes nearby and hike recommendations
HuKi can show hike recommendations for landscapes and positions using the popular hiking collections.
It does not include built-in hike collections but any GPX track can be shown from articles and hike-collections.

- Route planner
HuKi can be used to plan hiking routes. The planner always favors the official hiking trails.

- GPX File import
HuKi can import and show GPX file tracks in the map.
Using the imported GPX track, the app shows the altitude profile, destinations and creates a travel time estimation.

All of the visited parts of the map are saved in a database, which can be used offline.
The only thing to do, is to visit the desired parts in the map, when the app saves the tiles for 14 days.

- Dark mode support
