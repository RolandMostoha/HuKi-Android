# App Title
HuKi - Hungarian Hiking Map

# Short Description
HuKi helps you explore the hiking trails of Hungary.

# Long Description
Hungarian hiking map for hikers and nature explorers.

HuKi is based on OpenStreetMap and it integrates the Hungarian hiking layer. Simplicity and ease of use are the main goals of the app.
It does not include hike collections, but any GPX track can be shown with the GPX import function.

HuKi is my hobby project, I develop it in my free time and I'm happy to receive any feedback to make it more useful :)
